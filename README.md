# Farm-Shield
   FarmShield is a user-friendly management designed to assist farmers in handling pest and disease information. It enables users to register, add pest and disease records, search for issues by crop or symptoms, and display all registered users or records. Built using object-oriented programming principles, FarmShield ensures data security, scalability, and easy interaction, helping farmers make informed decisions to protect their crops effectively.
# OOP Principles
FarmShield uses these OOP principles:
1. Encapsulation: Information like pest details and user data is stored in classes (PestDisease, Register) and only accessed through specific methods to keep it secure.
2. Abstraction: Complex tasks like managing users or searching records are simplified into clear, easy-to-use methods.
3. Inheritance: Sharing common features across related classes for reusability (not directly in the current code).
4. Polymorphism: The displayInfo method in PestDisease and RegisteredUsers in Register demonstrate behavior specific to their data, ensuring clear and reusable outputs
These principles make the system organized, secure, and easy to update.
# SDG 15: Life on Land
     SDG 15 focuses on protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of ecosystems, managing forests, stopping desertification, and preventing the loss of biodiversity. It aims to ensure the health of life on land for the planet and all its inhabitants.
     FarmShield aligns with SDG 15 by helping farmers identify and manage pests and diseases effectively. By providing accurate information on symptoms, causes, and prevention, the system supports sustainable farming. This reduces harmful practices like overuse of pesticides and helps maintain soil and crop health. It also contributes to preserving biodiversity by promoting eco-friendly pest control methods and protecting crops critical for ecosystems.
